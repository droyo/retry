The retry package implements a handful of backoff strategies that
use the technique described in
http://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2014/backoff/ . Please
be advised that this package is still new, and while I am happy with
the overall idea, the finer details of the API may be changed for
a while longer.

API documentation can be found at http://godoc.org/aqwari.net/retry.
Issues may be opened at github.com/droyo/retry.
