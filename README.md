The retry package implements a handful of backoff strategies that
use the technique described in
http://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2014/backoff/ . This package
API is finalized and should only see backwards-compatible changes
(perhaps an additional backoff strategy or two).

API documentation can be found at http://godoc.org/aqwari.net/retry.
Issues may be opened at github.com/droyo/retry.
